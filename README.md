# TigerCode
This is the main part of Tiger Team's (#2679) code.
## Sub-projects
The code consists of three sub-projects:

 - Core
 - Robot
 - Path Planner

### Core
This serves as a library that includes most of the logic and algorithms. 
### Robot
 This includes the code that will actually run on the robot itself.
### Path Planner
This is a small GUI application that lets the user select points for the robot to go through and calculate a path.
